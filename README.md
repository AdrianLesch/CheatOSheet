# Cheat-O-Sheet Challenge Project

This was my first challenge project for the Codecademy Fullstack Engineer-Career Path.
I was learning for five weeks up to that point and used all of my HTML and CSS knowlegde to design
and create my first "own" website. Have fun!

## Here is the official project scope from the Codecademy website:

### Challenge Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet
#### Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy.
Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building.
There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

#### Project Goals
In this project, you’ll be building your own reference cheat sheet to help you build more websites in the future!
Although there are great places to learn HTML & CSS like Codecademy, the best reference for yourself is often your own notes and projects.
